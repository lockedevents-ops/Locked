    participant Merchant
    participant Hubtel
    participant Customer
    
    Merchant->>Hubtel: Initiate Checkout Request
    Hubtel-->>Merchant: Return Checkout URL
    Merchant->>Customer: Redirect to Checkout URL
    Customer->>Hubtel: Select Payment Method & Pay
    Hubtel-->>Customer: Payment Status (Success/Fail)
    Hubtel->>Merchant: POST Callback (Payment Status)
```

This API offers RESTful endpoints that integrate online payments into any application.

You may implement the Hubtel Online Checkout to:

- **Redirect to the Hubtel Website to taking payment** - Redirect Checkout
- **Take payment on your own website** - Onsite Checkout

---

## Redirect Checkout - How It Works

1. A customer arrives on your website and clicks on a pay button.
2. The customer is redirected to the Hubtel checkout page.
3. The customer selects how they wish to pay.
4. The customer verifies their identity by inputting their mobile number to receive an OTP.
5. When payment is completed, a success or failure notification is presented to the customer.
6. The customer is finally redirected back to your website via your return URL.

    participant MerchantSite as Merchant Website
    participant Hubtel
    
    Customer->>MerchantSite: Clicks Pay Button
    MerchantSite->>Hubtel: Initiate Checkout API Call
    Hubtel-->>MerchantSite: Returns Checkout URL
    MerchantSite->>Customer: Redirects to Hubtel Checkout Page
    Customer->>Hubtel: Selects Payment Method & Enters Details
    Hubtel->>Customer: Requests OTP/Verification
    Customer->>Hubtel: Submits OTP
    Hubtel-->>Customer: Displays Success/Failure Message
    Hubtel->>Customer: Redirects back to Merchant Return URL
    Hubtel->>MerchantSite: Sends Background Callback (Status)
```

---

## Onsite Checkout - How It Works

1. A customer arrives on your website and clicks on a pay button.
2. Your website loads up the Hubtel Payment page within your website, preferably in an iframe.
3. The customer selects how they wish to make payment.
4. The customer verifies their identity by entering their mobile number to receive an OTP or scanning a QR Code with their Hubtel app.
5. When payment is completed, a success or failure notification is presented to the customer.

### API Request Flow (Onsite)

    participant HubtelAPI as Hubtel API
    
    Customer->>MerchantSite: Clicks Pay Button
    MerchantSite->>HubtelAPI: Initiate Checkout API Call
    HubtelAPI-->>MerchantSite: Returns Direct/Iframe URL
    MerchantSite->>HubtelIframe: Loads Payment Page in Iframe
    Customer->>HubtelIframe: Selects Payment Method
    Customer->>HubtelIframe: Enters Details / Scans QR
    HubtelIframe->>HubtelAPI: Process Payment
    HubtelAPI-->>HubtelIframe: Payment Status
    HubtelIframe-->>Customer: Displays Success/Failure in Iframe
    HubtelAPI->>MerchantSite: Sends Background Callback (Status)
```

> [!NOTE]
> In instances where a merchant does not receive the final status of the transaction after five (5) minutes from Hubtel, it is mandatory to perform a status check using the Transaction Status Check API to determine the final status of the transaction.

## Transaction Status Check

It is mandatory to implement the Transaction Status Check API as it allows merchants to check for the status of a transaction in rare instances where a merchant does not receive the final status of the transaction from Hubtel after five (5) minutes.

To check the status of a transaction, send an HTTP GET request to the below URL, with either one or more unique transaction identifiers as parameters.

It is also mandatory to pass your POS Sales ID for Status Check requests in the endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> Only requests from whitelisted IP(s) can reach the endpoint. Requests from IP addresses that have not been whitelisted will return a 403 Forbidden error response or a timeout. Submit your public IP(s) to your Retail Systems Engineer to be whitelisted.
>
> We permit a maximum of 4 IP addresses per service.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| API Endpoint | `https://api-txnstatus.hubtel.com/transactions/{POS_Sales_ID}/status` |

## Response Codes

The Hubtel Sales API uses standard HTTP error reporting. Successful requests return HTTP status codes in the 2xx. Failed requests return status codes in 4xx and 5xx. Response codes are included in the JSON response body, which contain information about the response.

| Response Code | Description | Required Action |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 0000 | This ResponseCode in the initial response means the request has been accepted, you can proceed with the transaction with any of the URLs provided in this initial response. In callbacks, it means the transaction has been processed successfully. | None |
| 0005 | There was an HTTP failure/exception when reaching the payment partner. | The transaction state is not known. Please contact your Retail Systems Engineer to confirm the status of this transaction. |
| 2001 | Transaction failed due to an error with the Payment Processor. Possible causes include: MTN Mobile Money user has reached counter or balance limits, insufficient funds, missing permissions, invalid transaction ID, invalid PIN, USSD session timeout, or strange characters in description. | Review your request or retry in a few minutes. Ensure the number provided matches the channel. |
| 4000 | Validation errors. Something is not quite right with this request. | Please check again. |
